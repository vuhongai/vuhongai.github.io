2024-09-11,An engineered AAV targeting integrin alpha V beta 6 presents improved myotropism across species,Nature Communications,"Current adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy using nature-derived AAVs is limited by non-optimal tissue targeting. In the treatment of muscular diseases (MD), high doses are often required but can lead to severe adverse effects. Here, we rationally design an AAV capsid that specifically targets skeletal muscle to lower treatment doses. We computationally integrate binding motifs of human integrin alphaV beta6, a skeletal muscle receptor, into a liver-detargeting capsid. Designed AAVs show higher productivity and superior muscle transduction compared to their parent. One variant, LICA1, demonstrates comparable muscle transduction to other myotropic AAVs with reduced liver targeting. LICA1’s myotropic properties are observed across species, including non-human primate. Consequently, LICA1, but not AAV9, effectively delivers therapeutic transgenes and improved muscle functionality in two mouse MD models (male mice) at a low dose (5E12 vg/kg). These results underline the potential of our design method for AAV engineering and LICA1 variant for MD gene therapy.","Vu Hong, A., Suel, L., Petat, E., Dubois, A., Le Brun, P.

2025-10-22,Lysosomal damage is a therapeutic target in Duchenne muscular dystrophy,Science Advances,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a muscle degenerative disease affecting young boys, arises from the loss of dystrophin. Current gene therapy approaches aim to restore a shortened form of dystrophin (microdystrophin) via adeno-associated vector delivery. While recent clinical studies show promise, therapeutic efficacy remains incomplete, emphasizing the need for improved approaches. Here, we identified lysosomal perturbations in myofibers of patients with DMD and animal models, an overlooked mechanism of cellular damage in muscular dystrophies. These were notably marked by the up-regulation and recruitment of Galectin-3, a biomarker of lysosomal membrane permeabilization, to lysosomes, alongside alterations in lysosome number, morphology, and function. Microdystrophin therapy in Dmdmdx mice fails to fully correct these damages. However, combining it with trehalose, a lysosome-protective disaccharide, substantially improves the outcome, enhancing muscle function, myopathology, and transcriptome. These findings highlight lysosomal damage as an important pathomechanism in DMD and suggest that combining trehalose with gene therapy could enhance therapeutic efficacy.","Jaber, A., Palmieri, L., Bakour,
