[cite_start]This study describes the development of an engineered AAV targeting integrin $\alpha V \beta 6$[cite: 40, 41]. [cite_start]As first and co-corresponding author, I demonstrate that this vector presents improved myotropism across multiple species[cite: 40, 42]. [cite_start]This technology (LICA1/LICA3) is currently being utilized in several gene therapy programs, including DMD and LGMDR[cite: 33].
